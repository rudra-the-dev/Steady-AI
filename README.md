Steady AI is a goal-driven learning assistant designed to help users make consistent progress without wasting time or money. Users define their goals, timeline, and budget, and Steady AI delivers structured daily guidance tailored to those constraints.
🚀 Core Idea
Most AI tools require long prompts and repeated context to behave the way users want. Steady AI focuses on persistence and direction:
Goals stay remembered
Guidance is incremental
Recommendations respect budget limits
✨ Features (Planned / In Progress)
🎯 Goal-based learning paths
📅 Daily messages or lessons based on selected goals
💰 Budget-aware study and resource recommendations
📚 Book and resource suggestions with links
🧠 Personality / role presets (saved prompts injected in one click)
📰 Optional curated news relevant to user goals
🧩 Problem It Solves
Rewriting long prompts every session
Lack of continuity in AI conversations
No cost-aware guidance for learners with limited budgets
Overwhelming, unfocused AI responses
🛠️ Tech Stack
To be finalized
(Prototype stage)
📌 Status
This project is currently in early development / prototype phase.
Features, architecture, and scope may change rapidly.
